\arguments{\item{x}{x is this is the name of the previously created linval object.}
\item{geom}{geom is the name of the qplot plot type that should be used 
from the ggplot2 package.}
\item{hierarchy}{hierarchy sets the facetting configuration for plotting.  
Only the x variables in the model will be used in the hierarchy and the 
first x variable in the x portion of the hierarchy will be used on the 
horizontal axis for plotting.}
\item{frame}{frame is the name of the frame saved in the linval object
that you would like plotted.  The default is the plotgrid which is the
primary purpose of the package but the dataframe and the factor grid
can also be plotted for diagnostic purposes.}}
