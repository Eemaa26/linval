\title{Databreak divides the data elements into groups depending on the type that
they elect to use. Specifying breaks will allow the user to set the breaks
by hand for all variables.  These can be thought of as the bins of the
data that the user will specify.  However, if bins is supplied and breaks
is not, then quantiles will be derived as (1/bins)*100  of the data.
Think of bins as saying that you want nperc roughly even sized groups.}
\usage{
reduce_breaks(data, breaks = NULL, bins = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{datagrid}{datagrid is the name of the dataframe
  that should be used to develop the factorgrid and is also
  used as the source of values to predict from.  It
  contains only those variables that are in the formula for
  the proposed model.}

  \item{breaks}{breaks is set when the user would like to
  specify the data breaks for x variables in the model.}

  \item{bins}{bins is used when breaks are not set for all
  numeric variables or if it is desired that the variables
  be divided by percentiles equal to 1/bins.}

\examples{

str(selected_data)
# Notice the data types of the variables

break_output <- reduce_breaks(selected_data,
print(str(break_output$factorgrid))
# This output shows that the variable values were divided given the
# user specified numeric cutoffs

percent_output <- reduce_breaks(selected_data, bins=3)
str(percent_output$factorgrid)
# This output shows that the variable values were separated into
# groups as specified by quantiles as expressed by 1/bins

str(break_output$datagrid)
# This shows that the output contains the dataframe in its original
# form as well so that predicted values can be made and appended to the
# factorgrid in the ouput for graphics generation when breaks are given.
