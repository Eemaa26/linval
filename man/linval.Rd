\title{Breaks up the data into groups according to the user specified type and
then plots using the geoms found in the ggplot2 package.}
\usage{
linval(formula, data, reduction = NULL, breaks = NULL, bins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{formula should be expressed as the model
  of interest in the form y ~ x1 + x2 + ...}

  \item{data}{data is the name of the dataframe where the
  variables in the formula are found.}

  \item{reduction}{reduction describes how the data should
  be broken up to make plotting and visualization easier.}

  \item{breaks}{breaks is set only if the "breakslg"
  reduction is chosen. These are the user specified breaks
  and should be set for ALL x variables in the hierarchy.}

  \item{bins}{bins is set only if user would like to use
  the default equally sized bins or if they would like the
  breaks of numeric variables determined by percentiles.
  It's value divides the values into percentiles equal to
  1/bins. Default=5.}
