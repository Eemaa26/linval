#' Convert a dataframe into a dataframe whose variables are of Factor type
#' The direct factors function converts the dataframe of interest into a frame
#' of Factor type variables.  In an effort to reduce the number of factors
#' especially in the event of continuous variables, the values may be rounded
#' to 2 decimal places. The end result of this function is a dataframe with
#' the data as it was read into the function as well as a frame of the
#' variables in Factor form.  None of the observations in either of the frames
#' are reordered so that when the datagrid is used to predict the response
#' value, the predicted column can be simply column bound to the factorized
#' data frame for immediate plotting.
